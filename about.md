French Programmer and Open Source enthusiast. Born and raised in Nantes, France. Currently living and woking in San Francisco for a VOD and streaming company.

I also maintain [the SDL2 binding in Rust](https://github.com/AngryLawyer/rust-sdl2) and the mpv crate as well, even though this last one is less maintained and used.
